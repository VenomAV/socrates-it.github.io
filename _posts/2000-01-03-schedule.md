## Format
The event will be run as a two day [Open Space](http://agilecoachcamp.org/tiki-index.php?page=OpenSpace), facilitated by the outstanding facilitator [Pierluigi Pugliese](http://blog.connexxo.com).

## Thursday
The conference starts at 5pm on Thursday, May 12th 2016. This is the time to get to know new faces or meet old friends, have some drinks at the bar, explore the surrounding area etc.

Starting around 6pm the hotel will serve a buffet so that even people who arrived a little later will get something to eat.

Later around 7.30pm we will officially start the conference with a [World Caf√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Cafe), to help kickstart everyone into a great conference experience.

## Friday
Friday is completely reserved for a full-day [Open Space](http://agilecoachcamp.org/tiki-index.php?page=OpenSpace).

We start the marketplace at 9am and the first sessions will start around 10.30am. The last session timeslot ends at 6pm, which is also the time we all meet again in the marketplace room for a joint retrospective of the day.

Around 7pm dinner is available for around 2h, so everyone can start into the evening at their own pace. Of course there's lots of room for shared [evening activities](https://www.socrates-conference.de/wiki/2015/evening-activities) like board games, making music, hacking or just talking and having fun.

## Saturday
Saturday is also completely reserved for a full-day [Open Space](http://agilecoachcamp.org/tiki-index.php?page=OpenSpace).

We start the marketplace again at 9am and the first sessions will start around 10.30am too. The last session timeslot ends at 4.30pm. After that we again all meet for the closing of the conference and a retrospective of the two days. The closing of the conference will most likely end around 5.30pm.

Participants are free to come back home.

Open Space means there is no agenda, or rather: you set the agenda. This is your time, make the best of it! For ideas about what you can do in advance have a look at [this article](http://www.unconference.net/unconferencing-how-to-prepare-to-attend-an-unconference/).

Facilitation will be in English. However, it will be possible to run sessions in other languages.

## Evening activities
Participants organize evening activities. In other events like this one there were a multitude of things going on in the evenings, from music, over board games to live-hacking programs. And of course there's always plenty of people to just talk to, or continue discussions from the day.
